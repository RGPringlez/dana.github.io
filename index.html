    <p>I hope you know that I genuinely do love you my angel; you are the most important person to me in this entire world and I do not know what I would do without you.
        You have helped me through so much and I am eternally grateful. I could go on and on about all the things I love about you: 

        <ul>
            <li>your eyes</li>
            <li>the way your mouth turns down eeeever so slightly when you smile</li>
            <li>those deep and gorgeous brown of your eyes</li>
            <li>the way you twirl your hair when you're deep in thought</li>
            <li>and, last but not least, the absolute beauty and adorability with which you act</li>

        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
        This video is one of my favourites that you have showed to me; I love it for the way in which it portrays your love of all things cute and innocent. 
        You are my snappy my love, my kleine krokodil <3.
